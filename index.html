          <h2>Where?</h2>
          <p>We organize things on the Angular Buddies Slack - <a href="http://angularbuddies.com/">join here!</a> You're looking for the #foss-hackday channel</p>
          <h2>When?</h2>
          <p>On October 10th, we'll be hacking on <a href="https://github.com/formly-js/angular-formly">Angular Formly</a>.  Check out the project issue <a href="https://github.com/formly-js/angular-formly/issues/483">here</a></p>
          <h2>How can I help?</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>Fix bugs!  Issues with labels will be the easiest place to start, followed by any other issue.</li>
              <li>Write tests!  UI Layout already has a few tests but more coverage is awesome</li>
              <li>Add docs! If you're new to the project, what did you find confusing? How can that be cleared up for others?</li>
              <li>Reproduce problems! If an issue doesn't have a JSBin/Plunker associated with it, write one! It'll make future debugging much easier.</li>
              <li>Get the word out! Tweet, Slack, IRC, print this out into a paper airplane and throw it at your friends.</li>
              <li>Go wild! Add code coverage, write a blog, create a default JSBin/Plunker for future reference, etc, etc</li>
            </ul>
          <h2>Guidelines</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Please comment on an issue to let everyone know you're working on it</li>
            <li>Follow the <a href="https://github.com/angular/angular.js/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit">commit guidelines</li>
